# web-design-challenge
 
 
Website designed to artfully display results from a series of analyses on a speed dating dataset from Columbia University. Analyses produced three insignificant correlations and one significant correlation, providing insight into which factors affect success in speed dating. Factors analyzed represent mindset before the experiment, habit/familiarity with dating, and intentions for participating. Includes a secret surprise page!
